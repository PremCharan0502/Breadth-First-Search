## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/PremCharan0502/Breadth-First-Search/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Breadth First Search
Breadth First Search (BFS) algorithm traverses a graph in a breadthward motion and uses a queue to remember to get the next vertex to start a search, when a dead end occurs in any iteration.

   vector <int> v[10] ;  //Vector for maintaining adjacency list explained above
        
    int level[10]; //To determine the level of each node

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/PremCharan0502/Breadth-First-Search/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
